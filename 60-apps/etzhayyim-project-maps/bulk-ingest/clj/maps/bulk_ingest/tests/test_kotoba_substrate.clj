  "clojure.test port of `bulk-ingest/workers/test_kotoba_substrate.py`
  (ADR-2606064500 R2 / ADR-2606280030).

  Covers the pure feature/transit converters (kotoba-feature) and the substrate
  write seam (substrate). The python E2E spun a localhost HTTP recorder to assert
  the posted body + Bearer auth; here the HTTP boundary is the injected `:post-fn`
  swap seam — the same body + auth header are captured, no socket needed (the
  repo's injection-boundary idiom). Cross-checks against the canonical
  orgs/etzhayyim/com-etzhayyim-maps python (_LABEL_MAP / name_tokens) are out of scope for the bb
  port and remain asserted by the python suite."
