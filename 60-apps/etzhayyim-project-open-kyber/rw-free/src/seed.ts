/**
 * open-kyber rw-free — chart-of-accounts SEEDING, ISIC-pack-aware (ADR-2606037200 D2+D3).
 *
 * `seedChartOfAccounts` seeds the base IFRS-aligned chart, then — given a tenant's declared
 * ISIC activity codes — ALSO seeds the industry pack's `:pack/coa-ext` accounts, so the ERP
 * a manufacturer gets has Raw Materials / WIP / Finished Goods, the one a bank gets has
 * Loans & Advances / Technical Provisions, etc. This is the concrete "industry-tailored
 * ERP" behaviour: same engine, industry-correct ledger out of the box. Idempotent
 * (createAccount dedups on code), so re-seeding or adding a pack later is safe.
