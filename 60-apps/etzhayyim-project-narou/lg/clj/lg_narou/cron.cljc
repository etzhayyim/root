(ns lg-narou.cron
  "In-process cron spec loader (port of `lg_narou/cron.py`).

  The python module registered APScheduler `CronTrigger` jobs read from
  `langgraph.json`'s `crons` array. narou's langgraph.json ships `crons: []`,
  so the scheduling runtime is effectively unused; what carries behaviour is
  the SPEC LOADING + the per-fire input shaping (the `_rotateSceneByEpoch`
  walk over scene indices, snake_cased to match BulkSeedState). Those are
  ported here as pure, testable fns.

  DEVIATION (noted in PR): APScheduler crontab scheduling is NOT reimplemented
  (no cron-expression scheduler under bb, and narou declares zero crons). The
  repo direction (clj/bb over the kotoba Datom log) prefers cell-runner cron
  residency anyway. `start-cron` therefore returns nil when disabled or when no
  specs are present — behaviour-equivalent for narou's empty `crons`. The
  fire-input logic + spec filtering are faithful and covered by tests."
