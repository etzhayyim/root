# open-isic

Machine-readable ISIC Rev.4 (UN Statistics Division, International Standard
Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 4) published as
JSON and served through the shared LangServer + LangGraph + UDF runtime.

- 21 Sections -> 88 Divisions -> **272 Groups** -> 428 Classes
- Source taxonomy: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/isic (public domain)
- License: Apache-2.0 (code) / public domain (UN data)

## Goal

Give downstream projects — classifiers, dashboards, LLM tools, AT Protocol
actors — a stable, versioned, JSON-first ISIC dataset that can be consumed
without scraping the UN PDF.

## Layout

```
data/classes/{code}.json    one file per 4-digit Class (authoritative data)
```

Each class JSON carries `code`, `nameEn`, `group`, `description`, `includes[]`,
`excludes[]`, and `implementedAt`. The group → division → section ancestry is
resolved from the code itself (`groupOf` / `divisionOf` / `sectionOf`).

## Runtime

The Cloudflare Worker implementation has been retired to
`_archive/retired-cf-workers/adr-2604282300/60-apps/etzhayyim-project-open-isic/worker`.
Active writes and classification workflows are owned by:

- `00-contracts/bpmn/com/etzhayyim/open-isic`
- `40-engine/kotoba/crates/kotoba-kotodama/py/src/kotodama/primitives/open_isic.py`
- `40-engine/kotoba/crates/kotoba-kotodama/py/src/kotodama/handlers/open_isic.py`

Current coverage: **428 / 428 classes**, **4 / 4 BPMN processes**,
**4 / 4 LangServer tasks**, **2 / 2 UDF helpers**.

## Contributing a group

1. Pick the next unimplemented ISIC group (see the UN source).
2. Add one JSON file per class under `data/classes/` (`{4-digit-code}.json`)
   with `code`, `nameEn`, `group`, `description`, `includes`, `excludes`,
   `implementedAt`.
3. Run `pytest -q tests/test_open_isic_apqc_primitives.py` from
   `40-engine/kotoba/crates/kotoba-kotodama/py`.

No runtime code changes are required to publish a new group — the data files
are the interface.
