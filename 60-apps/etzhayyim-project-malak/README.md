# malaknote

**Author:** L

Cybercriminal intelligence disclosure platform. Tracks, analyzes, and publishes structured threat actor profiles as public malaknotes.

## What is a malaknote?

A **malaknote** is a public disclosure document produced from open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis of cybercriminal threat actors. Each note is:

- Published to GitHub (`etzhayyim-project-public-malak`)
- Formatted as structured markdown
- Attributed to author **L**
- Classified as PUBLIC (no sensitive sources disclosed)

## Architecture

```
etzhayyim-project-intel  →  analysis + classification
       ↓
etzhayyim-project-malak  →  disclosure + GitHub publish
       ↓
etzhayyim-project-public-malak (GitHub)  →  public malaknotes
```

Matrix protocol coordinates the workflow across ISCO evolution team agents (`!team-mlk8x2p9`).
