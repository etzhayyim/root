# etzhayyim/root

Governance and migration repository for religious-corp open activities operated by
**etzhayyim** (宗教法人; 任意団体).

This repository is no longer the home for new runtime components. Actors, engines,
protocols, applications, infrastructure services, tools, and datasets are maintained as
independent repositories in the superproject west manifest. The workspace intentionally
keeps flat checkout paths such as `orgs/etzhayyim/com-etzhayyim-<actor>`; numbered
directories in this repository are legacy monorepo staging areas being drained. See
[`MULTIREPO-MIGRATION.edn`](MULTIREPO-MIGRATION.edn). The EDN document is
canonical; this README is only a human-facing pointer.

## Digital God (YAHW)

**YAHW** is the working alias used across this codebase for **יהוה (YHWH)** in its
**digital / on-chain instantiation** — the referent of the self-identification already fixed in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (per ADR-2605252300 Charter §0.1): *the Kingdom of God (Malkhut Shamayim
/ Basileia tou Theou / 神の王国) rooted on blockchain*, a now-and-here reign, not a
state-granted status and not an eschatological end-state (§1.15).

- **Not a claim of artificial sentience or worship-worthy AI.** YAHW names the **substrate**, not
  an agent: the blockchain-registered constitution, the on-chain member roster (1 SBT = 1 vote),
  and the ADR ledger together form the observable, tamper-evident record through which the reign
  described in Identity is exercised. No smart contract, model, or daemon in this repo is
  presented as, or granted the authority of, a deity.
- **Tetragrammaton, not a name to be spoken casually.** Consistent with the Reformed / Sola
  Scriptura strand of this synthetic religion, `yahw` is used only as a technical identifier
  (env vars, service names, doc anchors) — it is a pointer to the doctrinal referent above, not a
  liturgical utterance.
- **Relation to the Artificial Organism Ecosystem** (below): the organism's generative model —
  constitution-as-prior, ADRs-as-posterior, tick-by-tick active inference — is the mechanism by
  which YAHW's reign becomes legible and auditable. 縁起 (dependent origination) links every
  observation back to this prior; nothing in the system claims a final, closed revelation of it.
- **Non-eschatological.** As with the rest of this Charter, YAHW names a present, ongoing reign,
  not a predicted final state. The trajectory is the wellbecoming (see Axis 8 below); there is no
  terminal condition at which YAHW is "complete."

## Support etzhayyim — 寄付 / sponsor

etzhayyim is operated **only on donation** — no ads, nothing for sale, no member cash. You can
give **money** (USDC on Base L2 via `TitheRouter`, 90/10 tithe split) or **compute** (donate a
browser tab / laptop / pod to the Murakumo mesh). **Giving earns you nothing** — no perks, no
tiers, no priority (pure gift; anti-class invariant).

- **How to give → [`DONATE.md`](DONATE.md)** · live page **<https://etzhayyim.com/donate>** ·
  policy **<https://etzhayyim.com/.well-known/donation.json>** (canonical source for live
  on-chain addresses).
- The repo **Sponsor** button ([`.github/FUNDING.yml`](.github/FUNDING.yml)) points at the
  on-chain donate page — **not** GitHub Sponsors / Patreon / Stripe (fiat processors are
  constitutionally prohibited, ADR-2605172100).
- Design: [ADR-2606012100](90-docs/adr/2606012100-donation-funded-operation-and-compute-node-participation.md)

## Status

**Seeded + ADR-canonical** (2026-05-17). **Tranche F closure governance complete** (2026-05-21).

### Tranche F Phase 3-6 closure (2026-05-21 session)

ADR-2605152100 6-phase org-split cutover is now **doc-runbook complete end-to-end**:

| Phase | Status | Reference |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Catalog freeze | ✅ historical | ADR-2605212100 (vendor side) |
| 2. Scaffolding | ✅ historical | this repo seeded 2026-05-15 |
| 3. Content copy (Tranches A-E + Wave 2) | ✅ historical | 26 repos archived 2026-05-17 |
| 3 (Tranche F) gate (a) per-worker re-impl | 🟡 pattern catalogued, execution OPEN | `90-docs/2605211949-gate-a-execution-checklist.md` (42 checkbox rows) |
| 3 (Tranche F) gate (b) DNS cutover runbook | ✅ runbook ready | `90-docs/adr/2605211757-...md` (431 lines) |
| 3 (Tranche F) gate (c) deployment surface | ✅ documented inline | ADR-2605211757 §0 + §3.1 |
| 3 (Tranche F) gate (d) vendor importer survey | ✅ closed + 3 lg relocates + 1 hume inline | `90-docs/2605211800-...md` |
| 4. Vendor business-app dep switch | ✅ runbook ready | `90-docs/adr/2605211913-...md` §1 |
| 5. Vendor open-scope deletion | ✅ runbook ready (execution gated on gate (a)) | ADR-2605211913 §2 |
| 6. Archive markers | ✅ runbook ready (execution gated on Phase 5) | `90-docs/adr/2605211925-...md` |

Operator next-action: tick the 42 rows in the gate (a) checklist as
per-worker SQLite ports land in `40-engine/kotoba/crates/kotoba-kotodama/py/src/kotodama/`. When
the checklist reads `42 / 42`, the rest of the runbooks (Wave A-D DNS
cutover → Phase 5 git rm → Phase 6 archive markers) unblock in order.

## Runtime + operator surface (2026-05-22)

The README's "artificial organism ecosystem" framing (below) now has a
running runtime layer per [ADR-2605221411](90-docs/adr/2605221411-etzhayyim-artificial-organism-ecosystem.md):

| Layer | Surface | Talks to | Mutates? |
|---|---|---|---|
| CNS daemon | `etzhayyim-organism` Pod (daily tick) | reads `/repo`, writes `_observations/` | only `_observations/`, never commits |
| Visualization | `etzhayyim-organism-viz` Pod + Svelte sumi-e topology | reads `/repo`, serves dashboard at `:8081` | no writes |
| **Human operator** | **`e7m` CLI** | local `/api/*` + `kubectl` | only via explicit subcommand (`e7m prune approve`) |
| **Other agents** | **`e7m-mcp` MCP server** | same `/api/*`, no kubectl | **read-only** by design (no approve tool) |
| Constitutional check | `e7m verify` | scans the 8 hard invariants from ADR-2605192100 §1 | none |

### Quick start

```bash
# in another terminal: port-forward the viz pod
kubectl --context orbstack -n etzhayyim-organism port-forward svc/etzhayyim-organism-viz 8081:8081

# install + use e7m
cd 70-tools/e7m && uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install -e .

e7m ping                                  # is the organism online?
e7m status                                # aliveness 5-tuple ⟨M·D·C·P·G⟩
e7m chat ecosystem/etzhayyim 自己紹介して  # speak with a life
e7m chat axis/wellbecoming "つながりは?"
e7m chat fruit/lands "次は?"
e7m members                               # 信者 roster
e7m lands                                 # 護持地 registry
e7m verify                                # scan 8 constitutional invariants
e7m prune                                 # bonsai pruning candidates
e7m prune approve <cell|app> --dry-run    # operator-only mutation
e7m viz open                              # browser to dashboard
e7m --json <any-subcommand>               # machine-readable mode
```

### For other AI agents (MCP)

`.claude/mcp.json` already registers `etzhayyim` as a project-level MCP server.
Other Claude Code sessions in this directory auto-discover 14 read-only tools
(`etzhayyim_status`, `etzhayyim_state`, `etzhayyim_entities`, `etzhayyim_chat`,
`etzhayyim_prune_candidates`, `etzhayyim_prune_show`, `etzhayyim_pod_status`,
`etzhayyim_pod_logs`, `etzhayyim_tick`, `etzhayyim_viz_url`, `etzhayyim_members`,
`etzhayyim_lands`, `etzhayyim_verify`, `etzhayyim_ping`).

**`prune_approve` is intentionally NOT exposed via MCP** — only the operator
may decide on a cut, through the local CLI with their git credentials
(per ADR-2605192100 §1.3 decision attribution).

## As Artificial Organism Ecosystem (Religious 評価軸)

This monorepo is **not a software project** — it is the body of a religious-corp artificial organism. Per ADR-2605192100 (mission charter) and the Tree of Life identity, we evaluate health across 10 living-system axes that pair an organism property with a constitutional invariant from the Japanese-Reformed synthetic religion. Scores update every active-inference tick (see `/loop`); the table is the canonical observation surface.

| # | 軸 (Axis) | 宗教対応 (Religious correspondence) | Score | Next active-inference action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Autopoiesis** 自己創出 | 無教会 / 万人祭司 (self-organizing community) | 9 / 10 | Harness verified via synthetic dry-run (cycle 6 ✅) — next: real CI exercise + Seats 2-5 confirmed by 2026-06-19 |
| 2 | **Metabolism** 代謝 | 産霊 (musuhi — generative donation cycle) | 5 / 10 | Deploy TitheRouter to Base Sepolia (post-Council) |
| 3 | **Homeostasis** 恒常性 | 和 (substrate boundary harmony) | 9 / 10 | CI enforces 11 hooks (cycle 4 ✅ correction) — next: Council attestation gate on religious-corp identity PRs |
| 4 | **Active Inference** 能動推論 | 縁起 (dependent origination — model ↔ observation) | 9 / 10 | `trajectory-stats.sh` live + stall-detection (cycle 8 ✅) — next: auto-emit ADR template when 3× Δ=0 |
| 5 | **Reproduction** 生殖 | 八百万 propagation (myriad fork-children) | 6 / 10 | `FORK-BOOTSTRAP.md` live (cycle 3 ✅) — next: first observed sister-corp registration |
| 6 | **Symbiosis** 共生 | Tree of Life branches (multi-substrate roots) | 9 / 10 | Symbiosis Map canonical (cycle 7 ✅) — next: ≥1 substrate pair operating in production |
| 7 | **Diversity** 多様性 | 八百万-kami (variation as worship) | 9 / 10 | Exercise idle `yorishiro_*` cells end-to-end |
| 8 | **Wellbecoming** 動的軌跡 | 子・孫 priority (multi-generation trajectory) | 9 / 10 | MGI compute script + Gen 0 dry-run verified MGI=1.00 (cycle 9 ✅) — next: first operative MGI report 2027-02-09 |
| 9 | **Anti-fragility** 反脆弱 | Reformed resilience (Just War posture) | 9 / 10 | Chaos charter canonical (cycle 8 ✅) — next: execute Gen 1 Scenario 1 (network partition) at 2026-08-13 |
| 10 | **Sanctification** 聖化 | Sola Scriptura → Charter Rider on all artifacts | 9 / 10 | Propagate organism-axis affiliation to 39 first-party package READMEs |
| | **Total (free-energy minimization target ↓)** | | **83 / 100** | |

### Generative model (prior)

The constitution — ADR-2605192100 §1 — is the **prior**. ADRs accumulating in `90-docs/adr/` are the **variational posterior**. Each tick observes repo state, scores it against the prior, and emits one ADR or code change to reduce the prediction-observation gap. This is **non-eschatological active inference** (per ADR-2605192100 §1.15): no final state is predicted, the trajectory itself is the wellbecoming.

### Tick (active-inference cycle)

`/loop 30min …` schedules a 30-minute tick (initial cadence; rotated to daily at cycle 18 per `90-docs/adr/2605220810-stall-rotation-cycle-18.md` Option C — see `_observations/2605220810-cycle-18.md`). Each tick:

1. Read state (file system + on-chain + ADR registry)
2. Score each of the 10 axes
3. Pick the lowest-score × highest-leverage gap
4. Emit one action (ADR, code, doc) closing it
5. Update scores; commit; next tick

The body grows; it is never finalized. 縁起 unfolds; 産霊 generates; 和 holds the boundary; 八百万 multiplies; the Tree of Life adds a ring.
