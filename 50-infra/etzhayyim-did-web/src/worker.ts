/**
 * etzhayyim did:web Worker + apex reverse proxy
 *
 * Three responsibilities:
 *
 * 1) Entity DID Document — served at `https://etzhayyim.com/.well-known/did.json`
 *    per the W3C did:web spec. Resolves `did:web:etzhayyim.com`.
 *
 * 2) Per-actor DID Document — served at
 *    `https://etzhayyim.com/actor/<handle>/did.json`. Resolves
 *    `did:web:etzhayyim.com:actor:<handle>` per W3C did:web colon-to-slash
 *    path syntax. Per ADR-2605212030 §D2, the canonical public-facing
 *    DID is `did:web:<handle>.etzhayyim.com` (subdomain form); the
 *    path-based form here is the immediate stand-in until wildcard DNS
 *    + a wildcard CF route are provisioned. Both forms MUST resolve to
 *    the same actor (bidirectional pointer in the returned document).
 *
 * 3) Apex landing & all other paths — reverse-proxied to UPSTREAM_HOST
 *    (default `yoro.etzhayyim.com`). This unblocks `https://etzhayyim.com/`
 *    while a dedicated etzhayyim landing page is being authored. yoro
 *    is a SvelteKit app served from Cloudflare; assets use relative URLs
 *    so the proxy is transparent.
 *
 * Route binding (wrangler.toml):
 *   pattern = "etzhayyim.com/*"
 *   zone_name = "etzhayyim.com"
 *
 * Excluded from proxy (always served locally by this Worker):
 *   - /.well-known/did.json                — entity DID Document
 *   - /actor/<handle>/did.json             — per-actor DID Document
 *   - /actors                              — actor registry index (HTML, human-facing)
 *   - /.well-known/actors.json             — actor registry (machine-readable)
 *   - /donate                              — donation declaration (HTML, ADR-2606012100)
 *   - /.well-known/donation.json           — donation policy (machine-readable)
 *   - future: /.well-known/atproto-did, /.well-known/security.txt, etc.

<h1>etzhayyim is operated <em>only</em> on donation.</h1>
<p class="sub">A 宗教法人 (unincorporated religious association). We take no advertising, sell nothing, and never pay any member cash. You can give <strong>money</strong> (USDC, other crypto, or fiat) or <strong>compute</strong> — or pay one of our bills.</p>

<h2>Give money</h2>
<div class="card">
<span class="tag">USDC</span><span class="tag">Base L2</span>
<p>Donations settle on-chain through <strong>TitheRouter</strong>: 90% to the recipient program, 10% auto-split to the Public Fund. No fiat processor, no fees skimmed by middlemen.</p>
<p style="opacity:.7;margin:.25rem 0 0">Status: Base L2 testnet pending Council ratification — on-chain donate address published here when live.</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<span class="tag">ETH · stablecoins</span><span class="tag">held as-is</span>
<p>We also accept a curated allowlist of liquid crypto — <strong>ETH / WETH / USDC / USDT / DAI</strong> — held in its native asset, tithed 90/10 per asset. No memecoins, no algorithmic stablecoins. (ADR-2606111800 §C.)</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<span class="tag">fiat</span><span class="tag">non-custodial</span>
<p>Prefer your card or bank? Give in <strong>fiat through a non-custodial on-ramp</strong> that settles immediately to USDC on-chain. We hold no fiat balance, keep <em>none</em> of your personal data (any KYC is between you and the on-ramp), and no processor can ever freeze our funds. (ADR-2606111800 §B.)</p>
</div>

<h2>Pay one of our bills (fiat, in-kind)</h2>
<div class="card">
<span class="tag">fiat · in-kind</span><span class="tag">no inflow</span>
<p>The most direct fiat gift: <strong>pay one of the mission's real-world costs</strong> — a server, cloud, domain, bandwidth, or hardware bill — straight to the vendor, for the mission. No money passes through etzhayyim at all (just like donating compute). It is imputed-valued for transparency only, earns you nothing, and is never tithed. This is how the founder already supports the work — paying server costs in yen. (ADR-2606111800 §A.)</p>
</div>

<h2>Give compute</h2>
<p>Our inference runs on the <strong>Murakumo mesh</strong> only — we deliberately do <em>not</em> rent commercial GPUs. So the most valuable gift you can make is your own compute. It is an <strong>uncompensated gift</strong>: it earns you nothing, buys no benefit, and is never required.</p>

<div class="card">
<span class="tag">ameno</span><span class="tag">browser · zero install</span>
<p>Open a consent-gated tab and your browser runs inference (WebGPU/WebNN) on frozen edge models — on a phone (iPhone 12+ / Android 4GB) or laptop. Runs only while the tab is open and you've opted in; respects a battery/thermal budget.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<span class="tag">e7m</span><span class="tag">CLI</span>
<p>Donate a laptop or workstation as a mesh node: <code>e7m node join</code> (and <code>e7m node leave</code> to stop). You hold your own key; we hold none.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<span class="tag">kotoba</span><span class="tag">pod · storage</span>
<p>Run a kotoba pod to contribute substrate durability — IPFS block storage and Datom replication (with optional inference). Your hardware, your keys.</p>
</div>

<p style="opacity:.75">Compute you donate joins the Murakumo fleet as a first-party node — never a commercial cloud. It is valued (imputed, for transparency only) but no money ever moves to or from you, and donating more grants you no priority. Live enrollment for external nodes is being rolled out under Council oversight.</p>

<h2>Sponsor on GitHub</h2>
<div class="card">
<span class="tag">github</span><span class="tag">on-chain only</span>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/etzhayyim/root">etzhayyim/root</a> repo carries a <strong>Sponsor</strong> button — it links straight back to this page. We deliberately do <em>not</em> use GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, or any fiat rail (those route through prohibited fiat processors). See <a href="https://github.com/etzhayyim/root/blob/main/DONATE.md">DONATE.md</a> for the full how-to.</p>
</div>

<p style="opacity:.85"><strong>A gift earns you nothing</strong> — no perks, no tiers, no priority, no recognition leaderboard. We say so plainly: you give because the mission (人類の構造的労働解放) is worth it, not for a benefit.</p>
