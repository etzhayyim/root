# akashi 証 — Coverage Matrix

Honest R0 coverage for public ad-disclosure sources. **R0 ships source planning
and schema coverage, not live collection.** A source counts as covered only when
it has:

1. `sourcePolicySnapshot` with `collectionStatus=allowed`
2. a methodNote for its adapter/parser
3. at least one fixture or public bulk/API sample parsed into
   `adDisclosureSnapshot`
4. source lineage preserved through creative/delivery/landing records

## Source Coverage Status

| Source family | Platforms | R0 status | Counts as covered? |
|---|---|---|---|
| social ad libraries | Meta/Facebook/Instagram, X/Twitter, TikTok | registry seed only; no adapter | no |
| messaging / portal ad disclosures | LINE | registry seed only; access-mode requires manual review | no |
| search/video ad libraries | Google / YouTube | registry seed only; no adapter | no |
| regulator repositories | EU / DSA-style repositories, election-ad archives | fixture-only bulk parser with lexicon validation; no live adapter | no |
| regional transparency portals | jurisdiction-specific ad libraries | placeholder only | no |

## Field Coverage

| Field group | Lexicon | R0 schema? | Live data? |
|---|---|---|---|
| source policy / ToS / robots / cadence | `sourcePolicySnapshot` | yes | no |
| raw public snapshot + payload CID/hash | `adDisclosureSnapshot` | yes | no |
| disclosed advertiser identity | `advertiserIdentity` | yes | no |
| creative text/media/category | `creativeDisclosure` | yes | no |
| delivery period, spend/impression ranges | `deliveryDisclosure` | yes | no |
| landing URL/domain/hash evidence | `landingEvidence` | yes | no |
| non-adjudicating cross-platform links | `adDisclosureLink` | yes | no |
| aggregate transparency report | `adTransparencyReport` | yes | no |
| malak evidence candidate | `malakEvidenceCandidate` | yes | no |

Closure fixture coverage exists for `adDisclosureLink`, `adTransparencyReport`,
and `malakEvidenceCandidate`; all remain fixture-only and non-adjudicating.
`adapters/dry_run_fixtures.py` exercises the local fixture set and validates
every emitted record without network access or writes.
`fixtures/dry_run/summary.golden.json` pins the dry-run record counts. A second
regulator fixture covers missing optional source-disclosed fields, and negative
fixtures prove malformed source records / malak-imported closure records are
rejected.

## R1 Promotion Rules

A platform source can move from `candidate` to `covered-r1` only when:

- terms/robots/API policy is reviewed and represented as a
  `sourcePolicySnapshot`
- collection requires no login, no sockpuppet account, no anti-bot bypass, and
  no interactive dark-pattern path
- fixture parsing preserves source-limited fields without inventing missing
  values
- `methodNote` states false-positive limits
- `akashi` tests prove no voter/person profile fields are present in output
- malak bridge remains disabled unless a reviewed public IOC fixture is present
- `source-policy-reviews.seed.json` moves the source runtime from `disabled`
  with an attested review transaction
- `source-policy-approval.schema.json` records the review transaction and
  rollback-to-disabled requirements

## R0 Gaps

- No live adapter code exists; current parser is fixture-only.
- One fixture-only regulator bulk parser exists and validates output against
  akashi lexicons; no platform adapter exists.
- Closure fixtures validate link/report/malak candidate records without live
  collection.
- Dry-run CLI exists for local fixture validation only; it has no network mode
  and does not write kotoba records.
- Dry-run summary has a golden regression fixture.
- Optional-field and negative fixtures exist for parser regression coverage.
- No live fetch runs.
- Source-policy review workflow exists and keeps every live source disabled.
- Source-policy approval format exists; the only example is fixture-only, not
  live collection.
- Cell scaffold exists under `40-engine/kotoba/crates/kotoba-kotodama/cells/akashi_*`, but every
  cell raises at import until ADR-2606022300 R1 activation gates are attested.
- Lexicon-specific invariant and fixture parser tests exist in
  `test_akashi_invariants.py`.
- `source-catalog.seed.json` is planning metadata only; it does not authorize
  collection.
