# akashi (証) — Public Ad-Disclosure Transparency Actor

**DID**: `did:web:akashi.etzhayyim.com`
**Namespace**: `com.etzhayyim.akashi.*`
**ADR**: ADR-2606022300 (R0 scaffold)
**Status**: R0 design scaffold (2026-06-02)

akashi is a kotoba-native actor for ingesting already-public advertising
transparency disclosures from platform ad libraries into a source-cited EAVT
graph.

It is the advertising-disclosure sibling of `danjo`: passive public records in,
non-adjudicating transparency records out.

## Scope

akashi stores public ad disclosure evidence as kotoba datoms:

- platform source policy snapshots
- advertiser identities as disclosed by source platforms
- creative text/media hashes
- delivery period, region, spend range and impression range where disclosed
- disclosed targeting summaries
- landing URL/domain/redirect/content hash evidence
- cross-platform factual links by source ID, advertiser, landing domain or
  creative hash

## Malak Boundary

akashi is not part of `malak`. malak is confidential CTI and agency-referral
infrastructure. akashi is public transparency infrastructure.

The only allowed bridge is `malakEvidenceCandidate`: a reviewed, source-cited,
non-adjudicating evidence package when a public ad disclosure intersects already
known phishing, malware, brand-abuse or fraud indicators.

## R0 Cells

These cells are present as gated scaffolds under
`/40-engine/kotoba/crates/kotoba-kotodama/cells/akashi_*`. Each one raises at import until
ADR-2606022300 R1 activation and source-policy review gates are attested.

| Cell | Phase | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `akashi_source_registry` | periodic | `sourcePolicySnapshot` |
| `akashi_disclosure_fetch` | periodic | `adDisclosureSnapshot` |
| `akashi_normalize_creative` | continuous | advertiser / creative / delivery datoms |
| `akashi_landing_evidence` | rate-limited | `landingEvidence` |
| `akashi_cross_platform_link` | continuous | `adDisclosureLink` |
| `akashi_transparency_report` | periodic | `adTransparencyReport` |
| `akashi_malak_evidence_bridge` | event-gated | `malakEvidenceCandidate` |

## R0 Coverage

fixtures, or collection jobs yet. See:

- `registry/source-catalog.seed.json` — planning seed for Meta, X, LINE,
  Google/YouTube, TikTok, and regulator repositories
- `registry/source-policy-reviews.seed.json` — data-driven review state; all
  live collection remains disabled in R0
- `registry/source-policy-approval.schema.json` — future approval transaction
  shape with rollback-to-disabled requirement
- `adapters/regulator_bulk_fixture_parser.py` and `fixtures/regulator_bulk/`
  — local fixture parser only; no live collection
- `fixtures/closure/` — non-adjudicating link/report/malak-candidate closure
  fixtures
- `adapters/dry_run_fixtures.py` — local fixture dry-run CLI; no network access
  and no writes
