  production lifecycle: handle-discover (spec → capability-match factory candidates), handle-
  compliance (G16 treaty + yabai screening, never auto-pass), handle-production (BTO/MTO/CTO order
  state machine, G14 member-principal, G2 SBT-gated), handle-qc (pass/fail→quarantine/rework), +
  build-settlement-intent (G7 10% tithe, :intent unless member-signed G15). Pure compute; the
  Murakumo llm rerank (_llm_rank_factories) is the omitted leg — a no-op when llm is absent."
