;; Clojure port of py/agent.py (yoro-supply procurement & logistics actor).
(ns yoro-supply.py.agent
  "yoro-supply 綾取供給 — material sourcing & logistics langgraph actor (kotoba WASM cell).

  ADR-2605250850, migration plan Phase 2. Runs in-WASM on kotoba :8077. Five
  handlers over one kotoba EAVT graph, mirroring the supply chain lifecycle:

    handle-supplier-selection   projectBOM -> capability/region match
    handle-order-placement      selectedSuppliers -> purchaseOrderConfirmation
    handle-manufacture-track    purchaseOrderConfirmation -> progress
    handle-shipment             manufacturingProgressRecord -> tracking
    handle-delivery-verify      shipmentTrackingRecord -> attestation

  LLM access is Murakumo-only via KotobaLLM (127.0.0.1:4000, gemma3:4b; G5).
  State is written to kotoba Datom log (G6). Charter Rider screening enforced
  (G2). Settlement is USDC Base L2 + ERC-4337 + TitheRouter 10% only (G7).
  Platform holds no key (G11). Every stage recorded as Datom (G13).

  This R0 build computes and returns plans; it does not dispatch real work and
  does not broadcast settlements (settlement stops at :intent).
