;; mesh.clj — danjo 弾正 R1 KOTOBA Mesh observatory + ingest orchestrator (Clojure / bb).
;;
;; The mesh-hosting face of actor:danjo (public-accountability oversight). Observatory
;; on-kse pattern (ADR-2606230001 §4). As of ADR-2607180900 (R1 ingest trio, Founder 1/1
;; bootstrap ratification) this component is the LIVE R1 entrypoint: on each observe it
;; orchestrates the R1 ingest trio —
;;
;;   • procurement heartbeat (autorun.cljc, offline pre-published corpus → discrepancy obs)
;;   • REVENUE beat          (revenue_ledger.clj, real JP revenue/tax → per-yen trace;
;;                            answers 「源泉所得税 / 復興特別所得税 はどこに使われるか」 honestly)
;;   • DIET ingest           (diet_beat.cljc, jp_kokkai 国会会議録 → EAVT datoms)
;;   • procurement/budget    (ingest_status.cljc, :awaiting-w3-fetcher — jp_chotatsu/jp_yosan
;;                            are W3 work; honest stubs, no fabrication G8)
;;
;; — and publishes the resulting heads + per-yen trace summary + ingest status to the mesh
;; (kqe-assert!, best-effort: no-ops when unbound under plain bb). The censor's EYE only:
;; every persisted datom is a FACTUAL public-record reference, never a verdict (G4).
;;
;; Env-var gate DANJO_R1_COUNCIL_RATIFY_TX_HASH at observe entry — the live-activation
;; switch (ADR-2607180900). The three datom logs stay in their existing, separately-tested
;; formats (procurement: danjo.methods.kotoba string-key tx; revenue: revenue-ledger
;; keyword-key tx) — this orchestrator runs both and reports both heads without merging them.
